        Parkinson's disease is a progressive disorder that affects the nervous system and the parts of the body controlled by the nerves. Symptoms start slowly. The first symptom may be a barely noticeable tremor in just one hand. Tremors are common, but the disorder may also cause stiffness or slowing of movement.
        <br /> <br />
    
        In the early stages of Parkinson's disease, your face may show little or no expression. Your arms may not swing when you walk. Your speech may become soft or slurred. Parkinson's disease symptoms worsen as your condition progresses over time.
        <br /> <br />

        Although Parkinson's disease can't be cured, medications might significantly improve your symptoms. Occasionally, your health care provider may suggest surgery to regulate certain regions of your brain and improve your symptoms.
        <br /> <br />
        Parkinson's disease symptoms can be different for everyone. Early symptoms may be mild and go unnoticed. Symptoms often begin on one side of the body and usually remain worse on that side, even after symptoms begin to affect the limbs on both sides.
        <br /> <br />
        Parkinson's symptoms may include:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Tremor: </b>Rhythmic shaking, called tremor, usually begins in a limb, often your hand or fingers. You may rub your thumb and forefinger back and forth. This is known as a pill-rolling tremor. Your hand may tremble when it's at rest. The shaking may decrease when you are performing tasks.</li>
            <li><b>Slowed movement, known as bradykinesia: </b>Over time, Parkinson's disease may slow your movement, making simple tasks difficult and time-consuming. Your steps may become shorter when you walk. It may be difficult to get out of a chair. You may drag or shuffle your feet as you try to walk.</li>
            <li><b>Rigid muscles: </b>Muscle stiffness may occur in any part of your body. The stiff muscles can be painful and limit your range of motion.</li>
            <li><b>Impaired posture and balance: </b>Your posture may become stooped. Or you may fall or have balance problems as a result of Parkinson's disease.</li>
            <li><b>Loss of automatic movements: </b>You may have a decreased ability to perform unconscious movements, including blinking, smiling or swinging your arms when you walk.</li>
            <li><b>Speech changes: </b>You may speak softly or quickly, slur, or hesitate before talking. Your speech may be more of a monotone rather than have the usual speech patterns.</li>
            <li><b>Writing changes: </b>It may become hard to write, and your writing may appear small.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <br /><br />The cause of Parkinson's disease is unknown, but several factors appear to play a role, including:

        <ul>
            <li><b>Heredity: </b>Researchers have identified specific genetic changes that can cause Parkinson's disease. But these are uncommon except in rare cases with many family members affected by Parkinson's disease. However, certain gene variations appear to increase the risk of Parkinson's disease but with a relatively small risk of Parkinson's disease for each of these genetic markers.</li>
            <li><b>Environment: </b>Exposure to certain toxins or environmental factors may increase the risk of later Parkinson's disease, but the risk is small.</li>
        </ul>

        Treatment of parkinson's disease depends on the specific symptoms experienced by the individual. Management strategies may include addressing the underlying condition, managing pain, physical therapy, lifestyle changes, and medications to alleviate symptoms and promote nerve healing when possible.
