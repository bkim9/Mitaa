            TMS stands for Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, a non-invasive medical procedure used to stimulate specific areas of the brain using magnetic fields. TMS involves placing a magnetic coil on the scalp, near the targeted brain region. When the coil is activated, it generates brief, focused magnetic pulses that pass through the skull and into the brain. These magnetic pulses can modulate the activity of neurons in the targeted brain area. <br><br><br>
            TMS has therapeutic potential and is primarily used in two main ways:<br />
            <ol>
              <li>
                <b>Therapeutic TMS (Repetitive TMS, rTMS):</b> In this approach, repetitive magnetic pulses are delivered over a period of time, typically daily for several weeks. It's used as a treatment for various neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions, including:
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Depression:</b> rTMS is FDA-approved for treating treatment-resistant depression, when other treatments have not been effective.</li>
                  <li><b>Anxiety Disorders:</b> Some studies have explored the use of rTMS for anxiety disorders like generalized anxiety disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder.</li>
                  <li><b>Migraine:</b> TMS has been investigated as a potential treatment for migraine with aura.</li>
                  <li><b>Neurological Disorders:</b> TMS is being studied as a potential therapy for conditions like Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, and stroke recovery.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Diagnostic TMS (Single-Pulse TMS):</b> In this approach, single magnetic pulses are used to temporarily disrupt brain activity in specific brain areas. This is mainly used for research purposes to study brain function and map cortical areas responsible for different functions.
            
                <br /><br />It's believed that TMS can modulate neuronal activity by inducing small electrical currents in the brain tissue, which can influence neurotransmitter levels and neuronal connectivity.
                
                <br /><br />TMS is considered safe when administered by trained healthcare professionals. Side effects are usually mild and temporary, including scalp discomfort or mild headache at the treatment site. Serious adverse effects are rare.
                
                It's important to note that while TMS offers promise as a treatment option, it might not be suitable or effective for everyone. A thorough assessment by a healthcare professional at our office is essential to determine whether TMS is appropriate for a specific individual and condition.
