        Vertigo is a symptom, rather than a condition itself. It’s the sensation that you, or the environment around you, is moving or spinning.
        <br><br>
        This feeling may be barely noticeable, or it may be so severe that you find it difficult to keep your balance and do everyday tasks.
        <br><br>
        Attacks of vertigo can develop suddenly and last for a few seconds, or they may last much longer. If you have severe vertigo, your symptoms may be constant and last for several days, making normal life very difficult.
        <br><br>
        Other symptoms associated with vertigo may include:
        <ul>
          <li>loss of balance – which can make it difficult to stand or walk</li>
          <li>feeling sick or being sick</li>
          <li>dizziness</li>
        </ul>

        Vertigo is commonly caused by a problem with the way balance works in the inner ear, although it can also be caused by problems in certain parts of the brain.

        Causes of vertigo may include:

        <ul>
          <li><b>benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV): </b>where certain head movements trigger vertigo</li>
          <li><b>migraines: </b>severe headaches</li>
          <li><b>labyrinthitis: </b> an inner ear infection
          </li>
          <li><b>vestibular neuronitis: </b>inflammation of the vestibular nerve, which runs into the inner ear and sends messages to the brain that help to control balance</li>
         </ul>
         Some cases of vertigo improve over time, without treatment. However, some people have repeated episodes for many months, or even years, such as those with Ménière’s disease.
         <br /><br />
         There are specific treatments for some causes of vertigo. A series of simple head movements (known as the Epley manoeuvre) is used to treat BPPV.
         <br /><br />
         Medicines, such as prochlorperazine and some antihistamines, can help in the early stages or most cases of vertigo.
         <br /><br />
         Many people with vertigo also benefit from vestibular rehabilitation training (VRT), which is a series of exercises for people with dizziness and balance problems.
        <br /><br />

        Depending on what’s causing your vertigo, there may be things you can do yourself to help relieve your symptoms. Your GP or the specialist treating you may advise you to:
        <ul>
          <li>do simple exercises to correct your symptoms</li>
          <li>sleep with your head slightly raised on two or more pillows</li>
          <li>get up slowly when getting out of bed and sit on the edge of the bed for a minute or so before standing</li>
          <li>avoid bending down to pick up items</li>
          <li>avoid extending your neck – for example, while reaching up to a high shelf</li>
          <li>move your head carefully and slowly during daily activities</li>
          <li>do exercises that trigger your vertigo, so your brain gets used to it and reduces the symptoms (do these only after making sure you won’t fall, and have support if needed)</li>
        </ul>

        The term vertigo is often incorrectly used to describe a fear of heights. The medical term for a fear of heights and the dizzy feeling associated with looking down from a high place is “acrophobia”.
