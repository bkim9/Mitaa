            Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is a medical treatment that involves breathing pure oxygen in a pressurized environment. This therapy is conducted inside a hyperbaric chamber, which can be either a rigid chamber that accommodates multiple individuals or a smaller chamber designed for a single person. The chamber is pressurized to levels higher than atmospheric pressure.
            <br /> <br />
            During a hyperbaric oxygen therapy session, the individual breathes in 100% oxygen, which is delivered at a higher pressure than normal. This increased pressure helps the oxygen dissolve into the bloodstream at a higher concentration, leading to higher oxygen levels in the body's tissues. This oxygen-rich environment is believed to promote various therapeutic effects, particularly for conditions related to tissue healing, oxygen supply to injured areas, and reduction of inflammation.
            <br /> <br />
            Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is used to treat a range of medical conditions, including:
            <ol>
              <li>
                <b>Wound Healing: </b> HBOT is often used to help heal difficult-to-heal wounds, such as diabetic foot ulcers, non-healing surgical wounds, and radiation-damaged tissues. The increased oxygen levels can enhance tissue repair and support the growth of new blood vessels.
              </li> 
              <li>
                <b>Carbon Monoxide Poisoning: </b>HBOT can help quickly remove carbon monoxide from the bloodstream, preventing tissue damage and improving recovery from carbon monoxide poisoning.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Decompression Sickness:</b> Also known as "the bends," this occurs when nitrogen bubbles form in the blood and tissues due to rapid changes in pressure, such as during scuba diving. HBOT helps to dissolve these bubbles and reduce symptoms.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Gas Gangrene: </b> HBOT is used as an adjunct to other treatments for bacterial infections, such as gas gangrene, which thrive in low-oxygen environments.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Radiation Injury: </b>HBOT may alleviate the effects of tissue damage caused by radiation therapy for cancer treatment.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Traumatic Brain Injury: </b>Some research suggests that HBOT might have potential benefits in treating certain types of traumatic brain injuries.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Chronic Non-Healing Bone Infections: </b>HBOT can support healing in cases of chronic bone infections that are resistant to other treatments.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Air or Gas Embolism: </b>HBOT is used to treat air or gas bubbles that may block blood vessels or affect blood flow.
              </li>
            </ol>
