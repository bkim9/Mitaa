        There are several types of headaches, each with its own distinct characteristics, causes, and treatment approaches. Here are some common types of headaches along with their causes and treatment options:
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Tension Headaches:</b> 
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Symptoms: </b>Mild to moderate, steady, dull pressure or tightness on both sides of the head, often described as a "band-like" sensation. Neck and shoulder muscle tension may also accompany the headache.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Causes: </b>Muscle tension, stress, poor posture, anxiety, and fatigue can contribute. Specific triggers might include lack of sleep, dehydration, or long periods of computer use.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Migraine Headaches: </b>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Symptoms: </b>Intense throbbing or pulsating pain, often on one side of the head, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light (photophobia), and sound (phonophobia). Some people experience visual disturbances (aura) before the headache.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Causes: </b>Genetic factors, changes in brain activity and blood flow, hormonal fluctuations, certain foods (like aged cheeses, processed meats), alcohol, strong odors, bright lights, and stress can trigger migraines.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Cluster Headaches: </b>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Symptoms: </b>Excruciating, severe pain, usually on one side of the head around the eye or temple. These headaches often occur in clusters over weeks or months, followed by periods of remission.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Causes: </b>The exact cause is unclear, but abnormal activity in the hypothalamus and changes in blood flow may play a role. Alcohol consumption, strong smells, and certain medications can trigger cluster headaches.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Symptoms: </b>Pain and pressure around the forehead, cheeks, and eyes. Discharge from the nose may be present. Sinus headaches often occur alongside sinus congestion or infection.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Causes: </b>Sinus inflammation or infection due to allergies, colds, or bacterial infections can lead to sinus headaches.

            </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>Symptoms: </b>These headaches are often linked to changes in hormone levels, usually occurring around menstruation, pregnancy, or menopause. Symptoms are similar to tension headaches or migraines.
                    </li>
                    <li>

            </li>

                        <b>Symptoms: </b>Pain that originates in the neck and radiates to the head. Pain is usually on one side and can be triggered by neck movement or posture changes.

                    <li>
                        <b>Causes: </b>Neck injuries, poor posture, and certain cervical spine disorders can lead to cervicogenic headaches.
