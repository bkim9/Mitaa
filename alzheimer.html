            Alzheimer's disease and dementia are related terms often used to describe cognitive impairments that affect memory, thinking, and behavior. However, they are not the same thing.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Dementia:</b> Dementia is a general term that refers to a group of cognitive impairments that interfere with a person's ability to function independently in daily life. It's characterized by a decline in cognitive abilities such as memory, reasoning, communication, and the ability to perform everyday tasks. Dementia is not a specific disease but rather a syndrome caused by various underlying conditions.

                    There are many different types of dementia, with Alzheimer's disease being one of the most common. Other types of dementia include vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, and more. Each type has distinct characteristics and is caused by different underlying factors, such as the accumulation of abnormal proteins in the brain or blood vessel damage.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Alzheimer's Disease:</b> Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia, accounting for a significant portion of all dementia cases. It is a progressive brain disorder that primarily affects memory, thinking, and behavior. Alzheimer's is characterized by the buildup of abnormal protein deposits in the brain, including beta-amyloid plaques and tau tangles, which interfere with communication between brain cells and eventually lead to cell death.
                
                    <br /><br />As Alzheimer's disease progresses, individuals may experience memory loss, confusion, difficulty with language, disorientation, mood changes, personality changes, and a decline in the ability to carry out daily tasks. The disease tends to worsen over time and can eventually lead to a loss of independence and the need for full-time care.
                    
                    <br /><br />While the exact cause of Alzheimer's disease is not fully understood, factors such as genetics, age, and lifestyle may contribute to its development. There is currently no cure for Alzheimer's disease, but there are treatments and interventions that can help manage symptoms and slow its progression in some cases.
                    
                    It's important to note that while Alzheimer's disease is a significant cause of dementia, not all dementia cases are due to Alzheimer's. Different types of dementia have different underlying causes and progression patterns, which is why accurate diagnosis and proper management are crucial for providing appropriate care to individuals with cognitive impairments.
